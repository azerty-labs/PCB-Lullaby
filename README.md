> Mixer of iron perchloride for pcb etching using a 3D printer.

Getting a good PCB etch can take time. It is sometimes necessary to move the etching fluid in a tank for several minutes. 

The general idea of this project is to use my ender 3 pro as a moving bed to mix the perchloride in my PCB production process. This is very useful to speed up the chemical process. In addition, the perchloride works even better when heated to 30Â°C, so the bed can be used to preheat the solution.
